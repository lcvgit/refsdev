# ISO/IEC 9899:2024

- add new keywords such as `bool`, `static_assert`, `true`, `false`, `thread_local` and others, and allowed implementations to provide macros for the older spelling with a leading underscore followed by a capital letter as well as defining old and new keywords as macros to enable transition of programs easily;
- removed integer width constraints and obsolete sign representations (so-called "1's complement" and "sign-magnitude");
- added a one-argument version of `static_assert`;
- removed support for function definitions with identifier lists;
- mandated function declarations whose parameter list is empty be treated the same as a parameter list which only contain a single void;
- harmonization with ISO/IEC 9945 (POSIX):
  - extended month name formats for `strftime`
  - integration of functions: `gmtime_r`, `localtime_r`, `memccpy`, `strdup`, `strndup`
- harmonization with floating-point standard ISO/IEC 60559:
  - integration of binary floating-point technical specification TS 18661-1
  - integration of decimal floating-point technical specification TS 18661-2
  - integration of floating-point types technical specification TS 18661-3
  - integration of mathematical functions technical specification TS 18661-4a
  - new maximum and minimum functions for operations recommended in ISO/IEC 60559:2020
- made the `DECIMAL_DIG` macro obsolescent;
- added version test macros to library headers that contained changes to aid in upgrading and portability to be used alongside the `__STDC_VERSION__` macro;
- allowed placement of labels in front of declarations and at the end of compound statement;
- added the attributes feature, which includes the attributes:
  - `deprecated`, for marking entities as discouraged for future use;
  - `fallthrough`, for explicitly marking cases where falling through in switches or labels is intended rather than accidental;
  - `maybe_unused`, for marking entities which may end up not being used;
  - `nodiscard`, for marking entities which, when used, should have their value handled in some way by a program;
  - `noreturn`, for indicating a function shall never return;
  - `reproducible`, for marking function types for which inputs may always produce predictable output if given the same input (e.g. cached data) but for which the order of such calls still matter; and,
  - `unsequenced`, for marking function types which always produce predictable output and have no dependencies upon other data (and other relevant caveats);
- added the `u8` character prefix to match the `u8` string prefix;
- mandated all `u8`, `u`, and `U` strings be UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, respectively, as defined by ISO/IEC 10646;
- separated the literal, wide literal, and UTF-8 literal, UTF-16 literal, and UTF-32 literal encodings for strings and characters and now have a solely execution-based version of these, particularly execution and wide execution encodings;
- added `mbrtoc8` and `c8rtomb` functions missing from `<uchar.h>`;
- compound literals may also include storage-class specifiers as part of the type to change the lifetime of the compound literal (and possibly turn it into a constant expression)
- added the `constexpr` specifier for object definitions and improved what is recognized as a constant expression in conjunction with the `constexpr` storage-class specifier;
- added support for initialization of objects with empty braces;
- added the `typeof` and `typeof_unqual` operations for deducing the type of an expression;
- improved tag compatibility rules, enabling more types to be compatible with other types;
- added bit-precise integer types `_BitInt(N)` and `unsigned _BitInt(N)`, where `N` can be an integer constant expression whose value is from one to `BITINT_MAXWIDTH`, inclusive.
- improved rules for handling enumerations without underlying types, in particular allowing for enumerations without fixed underlying type to have value representations that have a greater range than `int`;
- added a new colon-delimited type specifier for enumerations to specify a fixed underlying type (and which, subject to an implementation's definitions governing such constructs, adopt the fixed underlying type's rules for padding, alignment, and sizing within structures and unions as well as with bit-fields);
- added a new header `<stdbit.h>` and a suite of bit and byte-handling utilities for portable access to many implementations' most efficient functionality;
- modified existing functions to preserve the const-ness of the type placed into the function;
- added a feature to embed binary data as faithfully as possible with a new preprocessor directive `#embed`;
- added a `nullptr` constant and a `nullptr_t` type with a well-defined underlying representation identical to a pointer to `void`;
- added the `__VA_OPT__` specifier and clarified language in the handling of macro invocation and arguments;
- mandated support for variably modified types (but not variable length arrays themselves);
- parameter names may be omitted in function definitions;
- ellipses on functions may appear without a preceding parameter in the parameter list of functions and `va_start` no longer requires such an argument to be passed to it;
- Unicode identifiers allowed in syntax following Unicode Standard Annex, UAX #31;
- added the `memset_explicit` function for making sensitive information inaccessible;
- added `memalignment` function to query the alignment of a pointer;
- certain type definitions (i.e. exact-width integer types such as `int128_t`), bit-precise integer types, and extended integer types may exceed the normal boundaries of `intmax_t` and `uintmax_t` for signed and unsigned integer types, respectively;
- names of functions, macros, and variables in this document, where clarified, are potentially
reserved rather than reserved to avoid undefined behavior for a large class of identifiers used
by programs existing and to be created;
- mandated support for call_once;
- allowed `ptrdiff_t` to be an integer type with a width of at least 16, rather than requiring an
integer type with a width of at least 17;
- added the __has_include feature for conditional inclusion expression preprocessor directives
to check if a header is available for inclusion;
- changed the type qualifiers of the `_Imaginary_I` and `_Complex_I` macros;
- added qualifier preserving macros for `bsearch`, `memchr`, `strchr`, `strpbrk`, `strrchr`, `strstr`, `wcschr`, `wcspbrk`, `wcsrchr`, `wmemchr`, and `wcsstr`;
- added `@` (U+0040, COMMERCIAL AT), `$` (U+0024, DOLLAR SIGN), and ``` (U+0060, GRAVE ACCENT, "Backtick") into the source and execution character set;
- enhanced the `auto` type specifier for single object definitions using type inference;
- added the `#elifdef` and `#elifndef` conditional inclusion preprocessor directives;
- added the `#warning` preprocessing directive;
- binary integer literals and appropriate formatting for input/output of binary integer numbers;
- digit separators with `'` (single quotation mark);
- removed conditional support for mixed wide and narrow string literal concatenation;
- added support for additional time bases, as well as `timespec_getres`, in `<time.h>`;
- added support for new interface `timegm` to retrieve the broken-down time, in `<time.h>`;
- zero-sized reallocations with `realloc` are undefined behavior;
- added `free_sized` and `free_aligned_sized` functions;
- added an `unreachable` feature which has undefined behavior if reached during program execution;
- added `printf` and `scanf` length modifiers for `intN_t`, `int_fastN_t`, `uintN_t`, and `uint_fastN_t`
